      Transitioning from Technical Sourcing to Software Engineering is a natural
      progression fueled by a longstanding passion for technology. Despite a
      background in Finance and Accounting, my enthusiasm for computer science,
      cultivated in high school, remained a latent dream. Over a decade in
      Technical Sourcing provided a strong technical foundation, making coding
      an intuitive next step. Delving into coding a few months ago, I discovered
      genuine joy in the process, merging my sourcing expertise seamlessly with
      software engineering. This journey is more than a pivot; it's the
      harmonious convergence of skills and passions, transforming a career shift
      into the realization of a lifelong aspiration.
